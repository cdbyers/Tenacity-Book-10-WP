Sometimes this is because they have big pictures and few words. But it </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2697 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">is also because of the kind of language they use. They often use slogans: that is, a memorable phrase that is </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2698 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">used in all advertisements for the same product, e.g. (an advertisement for a deodorant) <span class="ffd1">Stay cool with Stay </span></div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2699 ffd1 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cool.<span class="ffcf"> However the language of advertisements often gives an opinion rather than facts. When looking at an </span></div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y269a ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">advertisement, it is important that we can tell the difference between facts and opinion.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y269b ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The purpose of advertisements is to make us aware of a product or service and, more than that, it should </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y269c ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">make us choose it over other similar products. To do this, they sometimes contain information which may be </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y269d ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">misleading. It may create an impression which is not based on fact.</div><div class="t m0 x1d h22 y269e ffce fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Example: <span class="ffd1">New improved Splash cleans better.</span></div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y269f ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Both <span class="ffd1">improved </span>and <span class="ffd1">better</span> are misleading. In what ways has the product been <span class="ffd1">improved</span>? In what ways does </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26a0 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">it <span class="ffd1">clean better</span>? Is it <span class="ffd1">better</span> than it was before or <span class="ffd1">better</span> than other products?</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y26a1 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Also important are the images or pictures in advertisements. Advertisers often try to create a lifestyle that </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26a2 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">comes with a product. In advertisements, we don’t see wrinkled old men advertising soap or a medicine being </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26a3 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">sold in a dirty shop.</div><div class="t m0 x1d h19 y2712 ffce fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">UNIT 6</div><div class="t m0 x1d h24 y2713 ffce fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A6.3<span class="ffd4"> “E” is for Empty </span></div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2714 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel, 17, wanted graduation night to be special. So, he reached into his pocket and took out some Ecstasy </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2715 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">pills. They looked harmless enough, but Daniel found out the hard way how dangerous Ecstasy can be. “My </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26a9 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">heart was racing so fast. I thought I was having a heart attack,” he said. A friend helped him to the party </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26aa ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because his legs wouldn’t stop trembling. Daniel tingled from head to toe. “Then I hit a peak,” he said. “I felt </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26ab ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">like a movie star.”</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y26ac ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Later at a friend’s house, Daniel crashed into gloom and confusion. He swallowed two more “E” pills. </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26ad ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Taking multiple doses within a relatively short time multiplies the toxic risks of any drug. With Ecstasy, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2716 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“stacking”, or doubling the dose, carries especially high risk. The level of Ecstasy builds up and the user’s body </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2717 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">can’t keep up with the amount of the drug in his or her blood. That’s what happened to Daniel. “I lay down </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2718 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the bed for a few minutes and couldn’t lift my head,” he said. “My legs were rocking back and forth.” </div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y2719 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The following weekend, Daniel took “E” at a party where some 200 kids were dancing. Before long Daniel </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y271a ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">was selling the drug. “I’d walk into a party and yell ‘E’ and people would crowd around. I felt a sense of </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y271b ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">power.” With the profits, he bought more Ecstasy which he took often, always with other kids. “I did drugs so I </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y271c ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">didn’t have to feel alone,” he said.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y271d ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Soon Daniel was taking up to five “E” pills a day. Desperate to feed his habit, he started selling cocaine and </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y271e ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">methamphetamine as well as Ecstasy. “I was skinny. My skin was the colour of paper. My teeth were rotting </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y271f ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and falling out,” Daniel said. “I would steal anything I could get my hands on. I stole money from my dad. I </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2720 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">didn’t see anything wrong with the way I was acting.”</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y2721 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Once, a friend’s mother wanted to buy drugs from Daniel. When he delivered the bag of speed to the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2722 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">house, Daniel watched his friend’s face crumple in sadness. “I felt really bad. I saw lives being destroyed </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2723 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">because of what I was doing,” he said. “I’d see people get real bad with E. They’d sell the shirt off their backs. </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2724 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This guy once offered me his bicycle for 40 pills. People tried to give me watches and stuff that I knew they </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2725 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">had stolen from their families. Another guy wanted to give me some women’s jewellery and a 40-speed bike </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2726 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">for a couple pills of E.”</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y2727 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls4 ws0">On New Year’s Eve, Daniel’s girlfriend called him a “drug addict” and a “lowlife”. He ran out of her house. </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2728 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls4 ws0">“Staring at the city hotels and gas stations, I thought I’m going to be living alone in the streets, and that scared </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2729 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls4 ws0">the daylights out of me,” Daniel recalled. The next morning, he went to his father and said, “Dad, I need help.”</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y272a ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Now a resident of a drug-treatment centre in California, Daniel has been clean for six months. He’s gained </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y272b ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">weight, and he cares about himself again. But he worries about Ecstasy’s long-term effects. “I feel like I’ve </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y272c ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">suffered brain damage,” he said. “Sometimes I get stuck in conversations, because I can’t find a word.” Other </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y272d ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">times he walks along the street and stops in horror, forgetting where he’s going.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y272e ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Daniel is trying to understand his past and piece his life back together. “I got into drugs because I felt like </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y272f ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">no one liked me. I didn’t care about anyone or anything. I just cared about doing my own thing, selling and </div></div><div class="t m0 xd hb y13 ffd3 fs8 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Z01_ENG_SB_ETHG10_0261_Z01.indd   243<span class="_ _15e"> </span>28/3/11   10:59:57 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.500000,0.000000,0.000000,1.500000,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
