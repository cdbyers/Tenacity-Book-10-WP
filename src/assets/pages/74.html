            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d yca9 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 927.53px;">businessman. He would have

            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycaa ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 906.524px;">servants, and would keep

            <div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycab ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 885.52px;">“Hello, Makeda. Come here,
                my dear,” a voice said. Makeda woke </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycac ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 864.515px;">from her daydream and saw

            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycad ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 843.511px;">The businessman was the
                richest man in the area. He was about 40 </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycae ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 822.506px;">years old and he was fat
                and ugly. Nevertheless, Makeda smiled at </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycaf ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 801.502px;">him because the

            <div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycb8 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 612.461px;">The businessman came
                closer to Makeda and whispered softly </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycb9 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 591.457px;">in her ear, “I could help

            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycba ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 570.452px;">shop tonight and we can
                talk about it.”</div>
            <div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycbb ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 549.448px;">Makeda knew that the
                businessman was suggesting that he should become her sugar daddy. She </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycbc ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 528.443px;">did not really like him,
                but he was rich. If he gave her money, she could buy the things she wanted. </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycbd ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 507.439px;">Then she could go to
                Addis Ababa where she would meet the young man of her dreams. As Makeda </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycbe ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 486.434px;">was filling her jerrycan
                at the well, she decided to go to the businessman’s shop that night.</div>
            <div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycbf ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 465.43px;">Makeda went to the
                businessman’s shop twice a week for about three months. He gave her a </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc0 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 444.425px;">little money every time
                she came. She bought handkerchiefs, <a onclick="showDictionary('perfume'); return false;">perfume</a> and some skin lotion with </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc1 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 423.421px;">the money. Then, one
                evening, when she wanted more money, she went to the shop and the </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc2 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 402.416px;">businessman told her to
                go away. She heard another girl laughing in the room behind the shop.</div>
            <div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycc3 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 381.412px;">Makeda felt very angry.
                She made up her mind that she would never have anything to do with </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc4 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 360.407px;">men like the businessman
                ever again. Then, one month later, she missed her period. She was </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc5 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 339.403px;">frightened and surprised.
                “I can’t be <a onclick="showDictionary('pregnant'); return false;">pregnant</a>,” she thought. “The businessman told me that I </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc6 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 318.398px;">couldn’t get <a onclick="showDictionary('pregnant'); return false;">pregnant</a>
                with him because he knew all about family planning and <a onclick="showDictionary('contraception'); return false;">contraception</a>.”</div>
            <div class="t m0 x10 h1d ycc7 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 297.394px;">When Makeda missed
                another period, she got really worried and decided to discuss her problem </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc8 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 276.389px;">with her best friend,
                Worknesh. “Please advise me, Worknesh. I think I may be <a onclick="showDictionary('pregnant'); return false;">pregnant</a>. What </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycc9 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 255.385px;">should I do? I can’t have
                the baby. My father is very strict and he’d kill me if he found out. What do </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycca ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 234.38px;">you think I should do?
                Please help me. I am very worried.”</div>
            <div class="t m0 x10 h1d yccb ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 213.376px;">Fortunately, Worknesh’s
                mother was a social worker with the local council. When she heard </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d yccc ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 192.371px;">about Makeda’s problem,
                she was very angry. She knew that the businessman was guilty of child </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d yccd ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 171.367px;">abuse, and that if Makeda
                reported him, he would be arrested, taken to court and tried for </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycce ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 150.362px;"><a onclick="showDictionary('defiling'); return false;">defiling</a> the girl. But
                she also knew that the businessman would plead not guilty, and that without </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d yccf ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 129.358px;">any witnesses, the judge
                or magistrate would declare him innocent of the crime. Also, Makeda’s </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycd0 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 108.353px;">father would be so angry
                that he would force his daughter into an early marriage, with no hope of </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycd1 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 87.349px;">allowing her to continue
                her education. In such a marriage, the young girl might be mistreated by </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycd2 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 66.344px;">an elderly husband, while
                the real <a onclick="showDictionary('criminal'); return false;">criminal</a>, the businessman, would not be imprisoned, but would </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d ycd3 ff3a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 45.34px;">enjoy his freedom and
