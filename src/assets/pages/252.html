It is estimated </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2644 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that by 2050 known supplies of oil will have finished. If this happened tomorrow, the world would come to a </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2645 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">stop because we are dependent on oil, particularly for transport. There is not enough renewable energy at the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2646 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">moment to meet the world’s energy needs.</div><div class="t m0 x1d h19 y27be ffce fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What can be done about the energy crisis?</div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2648 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">There are two things. Firstly, energy conservation, that is, to reduce the amount of fossil fuels that we use. This </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2649 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will mean that supplies will last longer. Conserving or saving energy is something we can all do in small ways. </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y264a ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">We can reduce the amount of electricity we use, by turning off lights and by making sure we close the door of </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y264b ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the refrigerator and freezer quickly. People with cars can use them less and can use public transport, walk or </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y264c ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">cycle. This will reduce the amount of oil we use. </div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y264d ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Secondly, we can use less fossil fuel by increasing the supply and use of renewable energy sources. This will </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27bf ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">be very expensive.</div><div class="t m0 x1d h19 y264f ffce fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What can developing countries do about the energy crisis?</div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2650 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The developed countries use very large amounts of fossil fuels every day. The United States uses far more oil </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2651 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than any other country. In comparison the developing world consumes a small fraction of world energy. In </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2652 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">these countries people depend on traditional energy sources, principally wood. This is because electricity is </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2653 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">either too expensive or not available. The more a country develops, the more it depends on oil and other </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2654 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">fossil fuels to provide energy for transport and for making electricity. This means that developing countries </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2655 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">will also be affected by the energy crisis. Therefore we should reduce the amount of fossil fuels we use.</div><div class="t m0 x1d h19 y2657 ffce fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">UNIT 11</div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2658 ffce fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A11.2<span class="ffcf"> </span>What do employers expect?</div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2659 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">What do employers expect from a school leaver? The answer to this question is not easy, but in general </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y265a ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">employers seem to look for a number of qualities in job applicants.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y265b ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the first place, employers like would-be employees to know their own minds. They like applicants to be </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y265c ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">decisive – to have a clear idea of what they want to do in life, as well as realistic notions of what is involved in </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27c0 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">achieving their goals. Thus, applicants who are career conscious definitely stand a better chance than those </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27c1 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">who are indecisive.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y27c2 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Clearly, applicants can only show this quality if they have done some homework before the interview, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27c3 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">to find out something about the organisation they are applying to join, and to understand the kinds of </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27c4 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">opportunity that might open up. They should also find out if possible about the history, aims and problems </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27c5 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the organisation; its products, if any; its training programmes; and the long-term job prospects. Showing </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27c6 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">evidence of your interest in the organisation will impress the interviewer. However, this does not mean that </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27c7 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the applicant should try to appear a ‘know-it all’ at the interview. Far from it! While employers expect certain </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27c8 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">minimum academic achievements in their would-be employees, they are far more interested in whether the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27c9 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">applicant is ready, willing and able to learn, often from fellow-workers who may, on paper, be far less well-</div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27ca ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">qualified.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y27cb ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">This last point is crucial. A new employee must have respect for those already employed in the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27cc ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">organisation, even if the latter are less-qualified. There are plenty of older employees around who, when </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27cd ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">young, did not have the same educational opportunities as the present generation. There can be no future for </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27ce ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">those new employees who look down on any of their colleagues or senior officers on these grounds. On the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27cf ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">other hand, employers do like their young workers to be reasonably ambitious. Organisations depend a great </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27d0 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">deal for their growth and prosperity on the willingness of their younger employees to improve themselves, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27d1 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and a spirit of friendly competition is usually highly desirable, provided it is carried on in a reasonable way.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y27d2 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, ambition is not the same thing as greed. Many young people, when they first get a job, think </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27d3 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that the world is at their feet. In their desire to impress their friends and relatives, they often bite off more </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y27d4 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">than they can chew in terms of financial obligations. It is easier to apply for a car or motor cycle loan than </div></div><div class="t m0 xd hb y13 ffd3 fs8 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Z01_ENG_SB_ETHG10_0261_Z01.indd   247<span class="_ _15e"> </span>28/3/11   10:59:57 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.500000,0.000000,0.000000,1.500000,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
