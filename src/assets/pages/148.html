Before implementing this programme, officials tested a new </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y181c ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 873.539px;"><a onclick="showDictionary('curriculum'); return false;">curriculum</a> in seventy pilot schools.

In late 1978, the government expanded the programme to include </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1820 ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 789.521px;">nine languages, and <a onclick="showDictionary('adopted'); return false;">adopted</a> plans to add five others. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y1821 ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 768.517px;">There were also changes in the <a onclick="showDictionary('distribution'); return false;">distribution</a> and number of schools. The government worked </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1822 ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 747.513px;">toward a more even <a onclick="showDictionary('distribution'); return false;">distribution</a> of schools by concentrating its efforts on small towns and rural </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1823 ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 726.508px;">areas. With help from the Ministry of Education, individual <a onclick="showDictionary('communities'); return false;">communities</a> built primary schools and </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1824 ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 705.503px;">their number grew to 7,900 in 1985/86.

There were still differences between regions in the number of students enrolled and a </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1826 ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 663.495px;">disparity in the <a onclick="showDictionary('enrolment'); return false;">enrolment</a> of boys and girls.

The student-teacher <a onclick="showDictionary('ratio'); return false;">ratio</a> went from forty-four </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y182e ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 495.458px;">to one in 1975 to fifty-four to one in 1983 in primary schools, and also increased from thirty-five to </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y182f ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 474.454px;">one in 1975 to forty-four to one in 1983 in secondary schools. </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y1830 ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 453.45px;">School <a onclick="showDictionary('shortages'); return false;">shortages</a> also resulted in crowded classrooms.

A teacher shortage made the problems worse. In </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1832 ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 411.44px;">addition there were problems of destruction and <a onclick="showDictionary('looting'); return false;">looting</a> of schools in northern regions as a result </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1833 ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 390.436px;">of fighting.

On the Day of the African Child in 2004, they launched a <a onclick="showDictionary('survey'); return false;">survey</a> to understand </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1838 ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 285.414px;">which children were not attending school and to find out why.

A lack of school materials, the second biggest reason (29 per cent), was related; families simply </div><div class="t m0 x20 h1d y183e ff8d fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 159.387px;">couldn’t afford to buy basic supplies such as uniforms, books, pens and paper.
