                Fati’s parents encouraged Fosu
                to visit them weekly, but the more he came, </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d y2498 ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 717.483px;">the more Fati grew to

                of what was happening, but

                marriage was to take place
                came. That night, as usual, Fosu brought </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d y249c ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 633.465px;">his bundle of firewood

            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d y249d ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 612.461px;">ceremony. Fati’s mother
                asked her to come over, but
                she retorted, ‘Na, you know that this man is </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d y249e ffc7 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 591.456px;">not my husband. How many
