These are known as fossil fuels. They were </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y27b0 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">formed in the Earth millions of years ago. Burning fossil fuels causes pollution. They are, however, the most </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y27b1 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">common forms of energy. Oil accounts for 34.8 per cent of all the energy used in the world, coal makes up </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y27b2 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">23.5 per cent and natural gas 21.1 per cent. </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y27b3 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Renewable energy includes water power or hydro-electric power (created by large dams), nuclear power, </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y27b4 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wood, solar power (from the Sun) and wind power. These forms of energy will not run out. Some of them </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y27b5 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">have disadvantages, however. For example, the building of dams to make hydro-electric power takes away </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y27b6 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">people’s homes and land and destroys the natural habitats of many plants and animals.
