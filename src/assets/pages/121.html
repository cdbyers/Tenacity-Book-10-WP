            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y32e ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 1032.55px;">I first tried drugs about
                six months ago, and now I
                can’t stop. The first time it happened I was at this </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y32f ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 1011.55px;">bar that me and my
                friends normally go to. This lad
                had a bottle of poppers and offered me some. </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y330 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 990.54px;">Even though poppers are
                pretty tame, they gave me a
                real buzz, which I liked.</div>
            <div class="t m0 x2f h1d y331 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 969.54px;">A few weeks later I went
                back to the same bar with
                my best friend and ended up hanging around </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y332 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 948.53px;">with the same lads. They
                were a good laugh and to be
                honest I was hoping that they might offer us </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y333 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 927.53px;">poppers again. But there
                was something different on
                the menu. They were taking pills. I’d never tried </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y334 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 906.523px;">pills before, but they
                said it was a special offer,
                “The first pill’s always free,” this lad told me. “You’ll </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y335 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 885.519px;">enjoy it, I promise,” he
                said. “It’s like the
                poppers but a bit stronger.” So I said yes and took two. They </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y336 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 864.514px;">were tiny and white, they
                looked so harmless. At
                first nothing happened, then the night completely </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y337 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 843.51px;">changed. I felt totally
                weird. My body was
                shivering, and I felt like I had vertigo. I couldn’t stop </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y141e ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 822.505px;">dancing and laughing.
                Which was quite frightening,
                ‘cos I literally couldn’t control myself at all.</div>
            <div class="t m0 x2f h1d y141f ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 801.501px;">The lad that gave me the
                drugs started kissing and
                touching me. It felt amazing, really intense and </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1420 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 780.496px;">weird. But I got scared
                because I knew it was just
                the pills talking so I backed off and went to find my </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1421 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 759.492px;">friend. I started to
                feel really sick, and I just
                wanted to get out of there. I was getting really paranoid </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1422 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 738.487px;">and at one point I
                wanted to beat up one of my
                close friends because I thought she kept looking at </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1423 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 717.483px;">me funny (she wasn’t
                looking at me at all.) It was
                turning into a nightmare. I made it home and was </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1424 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 696.478px;">really sick. I promised
                I’d never ever do it again,
                but I did. </div>
            <div class="t m0 x2f h1d y1425 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 675.474px;">After the first time I
                started to forget about all
                the bad stuff that happened, and just remembered </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1426 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 654.469px;">how good the rush felt.
                I remembered how perfect my
                body felt and how it was like I was going to </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1427 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 633.465px;">dance all night without
                getting tired. I couldn’t
                wait to do it all again. That’s the problem. You see the </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1428 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 612.46px;">thing about me is that,
                even though I know people
                who sometimes take drugs, I do it way worse than </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1429 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 591.456px;">anyone else. I always
                want more. I always want to
                take drugs. If someone offers me a pill I never turn </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y142a ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 570.451px;">it down. If we go out, I
                can’t have a good time if
                I’m not pilling. </div>
            <div class="t m0 x2f h1d y142b ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 549.447px;">I don’t take drugs on
                purpose. It started as just a
                thrill. Now I can’t shake it off. I don’t hang out </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y142c ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 528.442px;">with the same group of
                girls anymore, because
                they’re not as into the pills so they can’t keep up with </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y142d ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 507.438px;">me. They are worried
                about me, and have told me to
                stop, but now I’m in this new group and there’s </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y142e ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 486.433px;">always plenty of pills
                to go round. It feels
                normal.</div>
            <div class="t m0 x2f h1d y142f ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 465.429px;">I’ve got used to staying
                up all night, but I can
                hardly keep awake at school. I don’t really care </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1430 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 444.424px;">though, because if I
                ever feel low about it, I know
                I can just go out. It’s only now I’ve just typed that, </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1431 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 423.42px;">that I can see how far
                things have gone. I want to
                stop...I do. I want to stop because my uncle was </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1432 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 402.415px;">a drug addict. He killed
                himself as he owed so many
                drug dealers money. He left his two children </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1433 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 381.411px;">fatherless. I hope that
                I can change as I do not
                want to die, get ill or lose out on any of my mates </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1434 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 360.406px;">because I’m too drugged
                up.</div>
            <div class="t m0 x2f h1d y1435 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 339.402px;">I would strongly
                recommend anyone who is wanting or
                getting pressurised into taking drugs to say </div>
            <div class="t m0 x48 h1d y1436 ff6a fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 318.397px;">no. You don’t know how
                you will react against them
                and you can lose the people that care for you.</div>
