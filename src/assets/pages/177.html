            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1c57 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 1003.04px;">and the environment.

            <div class="t m0 x2f h1d y1c59 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 961.04px;">Water pollution can be
                defined in many ways.
                Usually, it means one or more substances have </div>

            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1c5f ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 835.008px;">ink probably would not
                present any real problem.
                However, if you poured gallons of ink into a </div>

                an effect on the quality of

            <div class="t m0 x2f h1d y1c71 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 456.927px;">Another type of
                pollution involves the disruption
                of sediments (fine-grained powders) that </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1c72 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 435.923px;">flow from rivers into
                the sea. Dams built for
                hydro-electric power or water reservoirs can reduce </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1c73 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 414.918px;">the sediment flow. This
                reduces the formation of
                beaches, increases coastal erosion, and reduces </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1c74 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 393.914px;">the flow of nutrients
                from rivers into seas
                (potentially reducing coastal fish stocks). Increased </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1c75 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 372.909px;">sediments can also
                present a problem. During
                construction work, soil, rock, and other fine powders </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1c76 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 351.905px;">sometimes enter nearby
                rivers in large quantities,
                causing it to become turbid (muddy or silted). </div>
            <div class="t m0 x20 h1d y1c77 ff99 fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 330.9px;">The extra sediment can
                block the gills of fish,
