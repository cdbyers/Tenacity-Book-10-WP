The government therefore has introduced </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2730 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">incentives aimed at helping the rural population of Ethiopia, which exempts them from paying tuition fees. </div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y2731 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">However, urban areas seem to enjoy a better quality of education, where schools benefit from experienced </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2732 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">teachers and adequate educational materials. In 2006 primary education reached 89.41 per cent of children, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2763 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and secondary level education reached 30.9 per cent. The technical and vocational education also showed </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2764 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an increase in students from 3,000 to 110,000.

Astronauts say it is the most significant physical detail on the planet that is visible </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y276c ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from space. In Africa, the terrain ranges from salt flats more than 152 metres below sea level, to towering, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y276d ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">snow-capped mountains. The Rift is known for its spectacular scenery and abundant, sometimes unique, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y276e ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wildlife. A series of some 30 lakes lies along its length. The African Rift Valley lakes include some of the oldest, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y276f ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">largest, and deepest lakes in the world. Many are freshwater, while others are alkaline or soda lakes. </div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y2770 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Ethiopian Rift Valley forms the northernmost section of the African Rift Valley and splits the Ethiopian </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2771 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">highlands into northern and southern halves. The Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes occupy the floor of the Rift Valley </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2772 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between the two highlands and most are alkaline. Most of the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes do not have an </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2773 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outlet and as such form small pockets of water in the land which the local people have come to live off.

The <span class="ffce">Eastern Rift</span> is home to the Kenyan </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2776 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lakes, while most of the Central African Rift Valley lakes lie in the Western Rift. Lake Turkana is the largest of </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2777 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Kenyan lakes, on the border of Kenya and Ethiopia. The Kenyan section is home to eight lakes, of which </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2778 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two are freshwater and the rest alkaline. Of the latter, the shallow soda lakes of the Eastern Rift Valley where </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2779 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crystallized salt turns the shores white, are famous for the large flocks of flamingo that feed on shellfish.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y277a ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The lakes of the <span class="ffce">Western</span> or Albertine Rift, together with Lake Victoria, the second-largest freshwater lake </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y277b ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the world, include the largest, deepest, and oldest of the Rift Valley lakes. The Western Rift Valley lakes are </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y277c ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">freshwater. They are also referred to as the Central African lakes. Lakes Albert, Victoria, and Edward are part of </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y277d ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Nile River basin.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y277e ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0"> The <span class="ffce">Southern Rift Valley</span> lakes are like the Western Rift Valley lakes in that, with one exception, they are </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y277f ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">freshwater lakes.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y2780 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A wide variety of fauna inhabit the Rift Valley.

Four days into its journey the Titanic struck an iceberg and sank at 2:20am on April 15th. 1,517 people </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2787 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">died in the tragedy, most of them due to the fact that the ship only had enough lifeboats for 1,178 people. </div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y2788 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The night of Sunday, 14 April 1912, was calm and clear, but the moon was not visible.

During the course of the day, two warnings, one from </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y278b ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the steamer Amerika, told Titanic that large icebergs were in its path, but neither message was relayed to the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y278c ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">captain on the bridge. </div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y278d ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Around 23.40, the ship’s lookout sounded the alarm, and telephoned the bridge with the warning, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y278e ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“Iceberg, right ahead!”.
