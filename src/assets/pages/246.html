There was a noise in the compound. The </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26d8 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">door was forced open and torchlight flashed in my face.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y26d9 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Four men pulled me out of my bed. My grandmother pleaded with them to leave me since I was still quite </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26da ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">young and an orphan. I struggled with them and tried to bite one of them. He gave me a strong blow on the </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26db ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">back of my head as they pulled me outside. In the compound there were already a number of other children </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26dc ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">tied together with sisal ropes around their waists.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y26dd ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">I was given a heavy load of groundnuts to carry with the warning that if it fell down, I would be killed. The </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26de ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">following day, I was given mortar shells tied in a piece of cloth to carry. They were very heavy. I also feared </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26df ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">that they might explode at any time. At the time there was a man with a gun following me and watching me </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26e0 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">closely so that I didn’t throw down the shells.

It was </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26e2 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">getting dark and rain clouds were starting to gather with thunder and lightning. I slid off the line and hid in </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26e3 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">an abandoned house near where we were passing. Luckily, the adult rebel in our group was still behind me </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26e4 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">and did not see me.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y26e5 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the morning I tried to retrace my way back through the bushes. In the jungle I was alone, hungry and </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26e6 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">thirsty, with nothing to eat. For three days I was lost. I fed on wild fruits and drank stagnant water. I was </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y26e7 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">eventually escorted home by some kind people I met on the road.
