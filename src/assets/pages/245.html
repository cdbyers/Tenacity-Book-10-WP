There are things all over the floor. There are cooking pots and knives </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y2696 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on the floor, and chickens run around inside the house. Weizero Ha Ha cooks on a paraffin stove on the floor. </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y2697 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">She keeps the paraffin in a bottle which she puts on the floor, and she keeps the matches on the floor too.</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y2698 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My mother went to see Weizero Ha Ha. She told her, “Don’t put things on the floor. They might cause an </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y2699 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accident. Baby Ha might drink the paraffin or cut herself on the knives.” But Weizero Ha Ha just laughed at </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y269a ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">her.</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y269b ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Near the house the grass is long, with broken bottles and rusty wire in it. Rats live in the grass and last </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y269c ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">week I saw a snake. My mother said to Ato Ha Ha, “Why don’t you cut the grass? Baby Ha might have an </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y269d ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">accident or get bitten.” Ato Ha Ha laughed at her. He just went into the house and played the radio and drank </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y269e ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">beer.</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y269f ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">My mother said to me later, “Many children have accidents at home. Some get bitten by snakes, or get cuts </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26a0 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">on their feet and do not wash them. Then the cuts go bad and the children must go to hospital. Last year ten </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26a1 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">children in the village had burns from accidents from stoves and cooking fires, and two of them died.” </div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y26a2 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Just then we heard a cry from next door “Waah! Waah…!” The chickens ran out of the house and I ran </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26a3 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">inside. Baby Ha was on the floor crying and crying. But that was not all. The paraffin stove was on its side on </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26a4 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the floor. The hot cooking pot was on the floor beside it and the bed was on fire. Mother and Weizero Ha Ha </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26a5 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">ran into the house as well. We took Baby Ha outside, then I ran to fetch some water. In the end we put out </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26a6 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the fire, and the house was saved.</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y26a7 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“That’s why you must look after your baby,” Mother said to Abeba later on. “You see, accidents can happen </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26a8 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">only too easily.”</div><div class="t m0 x11b h19 y26a9 ffce fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">A2.9 A nose bleed</div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26aa ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">At the next meeting of the Health Club, the health worker told the members how to help someone with a </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26ab ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">nose bleed. She said the best thing was to tell the patient to sit down and breathe through the mouth. Then </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26ac ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the patient should pinch the soft part of the nose, at the same time tilting the head forward and down. If the </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26ad ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">bleeding does not stop after 10 minutes, take the patient to the clinic.</div><div class="t m0 x11b h19 y26ae ffce fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">B2.7 What would you do?</div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26af ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">One e<span class="_ _b"></span>vening Gemechu and Makeda were getting wa<span class="_ _3"></span>ter from the pump at the end of<span class="_ _b"></span> their street when they </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26b0 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">saw a bag lying by the side of<span class="_ _b"></span> the road. “I wonder what<span class="_ _d"></span>’<span class="_ _3"></span>s inside that bag<span class="_ _b"></span>,” said Gemechu. “Let<span class="_ _d"></span>’s pick it up and </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26b1 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">see.”</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y26b2 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Inside the bag was a small box. Gemechu opened the box and said, “Look, there are sweets inside. Let’s eat </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26b3 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them. Here, you are, have one,” and she offered the box to Makeda.</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y26b4 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">But Makeda said, “No, we shouldn’t eat them. Firstly, they aren’t ours. Secondly, we don’t know what  </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26b5 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">they are.”</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y26b6 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“Come on. Nobody will know that we found them, and they look nice,” said Gemechu. “I’m going to have </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26b7 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">one.”</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y26b8 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“No, don’t. Look, there’s something printed on the box. It says ‘Keep out of children’s reach’,” said Makeda.</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y26b9 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“What should we do with them?” asked Gemechu. “Shall we throw them away?”</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y26ba ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“No!” said Makeda. “We shouldn’t throw them away. A baby, who can’t read, might find them and eat </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26bb ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">them. They may be poisonous and would kill him. I think we ought to take them home and show them to </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26bc ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Mother. She’ll know what to do with them.”</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y26bd ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The two girls took the box home and showed it to their mother. She was shocked when she saw the box. </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26be ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“My goodness,” she said. “These aren’t sweets, they’re pills. It’s a good thing you didn’t eat them.”</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y26bf ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gemechu said, “Why, Mother?”</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y26c0 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“Because they could make you very ill,” Mother replied. “If you ever find anything and you don’t know </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26c1 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">what it is, you shouldn’t touch it. One of you should get help from an adult and the other one should stand </div><div class="t m0 x11b h1d y26c2 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">some distance away from it and stop other children from touching it. Do you understand?”</div><div class="t m0 x1e h1d y26c3 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">“Yes, Mother,” said the girls. “We promise that we’ll never touch any strange thing again.”</div></div><div class="t m0 xd hb y13 ffd3 fs8 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0">Z01_ENG_SB_ETHG10_0261_Z01.indd   240<span class="_ _15e"> </span>28/3/11   10:59:56 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.500000,0.000000,0.000000,1.500000,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div></div>
