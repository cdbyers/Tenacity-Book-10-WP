He shouted, ‘Wake </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y783 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 728.924px;">up! Get up!’ We were not let out of cells until 6.45. Before that we had to clean our cells and roll </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y784 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 707.919px;">up our mats and blankets. We had no running water in our cells and instead of toilets had iron </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y785 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 686.915px;">buckets. They had to be thoroughly cleaned in the sinks at the end of the corridor or they smelt </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y786 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 665.91px;">very bad.</div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y787 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 644.906px;"> Breakfast was given to us in our cells. We were given porridge made from maize. We also </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y788 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 623.901px;">received a cup of what was described as coffee, but which was in fact ground-up maize. The </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y789 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 602.897px;">maize was baked until it was black, then mixed with hot water.</div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y78a ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 581.892px;">In the middle of breakfast, the guards shouted, ‘Fall in! Fall in!’, and we stood outside our </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y78b ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 560.888px;">cells for inspection. Our prison jackets had to be buttoned up and we had to take off our hats </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y78c ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 539.883px;">as the <a onclick="showDictionary('warder'); return false;">warder</a> walked by. If we didn’t do these things we were punished with either solitary </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y78d ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 518.879px;">confinement or the loss of meals.</div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y78e ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 497.874px;">After inspection we worked outside hammering stones until noon. There were no breaks; if </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y78f ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 476.87px;">we slowed down, the <a onclick="showDictionary('warder'); return false;">warders</a> shouted at us. At noon, the bell sounded for lunch. For Africans, </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y790 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 455.865px;">lunch was boiled maize. We often received <span class="ff32">phuzamandla</span>, which is a drink made from maize </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y791 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 434.861px;">and a bit of yeast.</div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y792 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 413.856px;">After lunch we worked until four. Then the guards blew whistles and we once again lined </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y793 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 392.852px;">up to be counted and inspected. We then had half an hour to clean up. The bathroom at the </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y794 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 371.847px;">end of our corridor had two saltwater showers, a saltwater tap, and three large metal buckets, </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y795 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 350.843px;">which were used as bathtubs. There was no hot water. We soaped ourselves with the salty water, </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y796 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 329.838px;">washing off the dust from the day. We sometimes sang while washing, which made the water </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y797 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 308.834px;">seem less icy. This was one of the only times we could have a conversation.</div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y798 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 287.829px;">At exactly 4.30, there was always a loud knock on the wooden door, which meant that supper </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y799 ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 266.825px;">had been delivered. We again received porridge, sometimes with a carrot or piece of cabbage </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y79a ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 245.82px;">thrown in. Every other day, we received a small piece of meat with our porridge. The meat was </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y79b ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 224.816px;">mostly <a onclick="showDictionary('gristle'); return false;">gristle</a>.</div><div class="t m0 x89 h1d y79c ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 203.811px;">At 8 pm, the night <a onclick="showDictionary('warder'); return false;">warder</a> locked himself in the corridor with us. He passed the key through </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y79d ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 182.807px;">a small hole in the door to another <a onclick="showDictionary('warder'); return false;">warder</a> outside. The <a onclick="showDictionary('warder'); return false;">warder</a> then walked up and down the </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y79e ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 161.802px;">corridor, telling us to go to sleep. When we were quiet, he sat down in the small office at the </div><div class="t m0 x10 h1d y79f ff2e fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: 140.798px;">end of the corridor and slept until morning.</div></div><div class="t m0 xd hb y13 ff34 fs8 fc2 sc0 ls0 ws0" style="bottom: -65px;">M03_ENG_SB_ETHG10_0261_M03.indd   39<span class="_ _46"> </span>28/3/11   10:37:25 am</div></div><div class="pi" data-data="{&quot;ctm&quot;:[1.500000,0.000000,0.000000,1.500000,0.000000,0.000000]}"></div><audio controls="" src="assets/audio/13 SB10 U3 A3.9 P38_2.mp3" style="position: absolute; height: 54px; top: 407px;"></audio></div>
