    text="One day a lion fell into a deep hole in the ground. A monkey came along and the lion said “Please help me, monkey. I can’t get out.” The monkey did not want to help the lion because he was afraid that the lion would eat him. But the lion said, I promise I won’t eat you.” So the foolish monkey helped the lion get out of the hole. But the lion did not keep his word. He grabbed the monkey and said, “Now I’m going to eat you up.” Just then a hare came along and the monkey asked the hare to judge the case. “This is a very difficult problem,” said the hare. “You will have to show me exactly what happened.” “All right,” said the lion, and he jumped back into the hole. The monkey said, “I was walking along like this …” when the hare interrupted him. “Don’t be stupid,” said the hare. “The lion can’t hurt us now.” So the monkey and the hare went home, and left the lion in the hole."
