Astronauts say it is the most significant physical detail on the planet that is visible </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y276c ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">from space. In Africa, the terrain ranges from salt flats more than 152 metres below sea level, to towering, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y276d ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">snow-capped mountains. The Rift is known for its spectacular scenery and abundant, sometimes unique, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y276e ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">wildlife. A series of some 30 lakes lies along its length. The African Rift Valley lakes include some of the oldest, </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y276f ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">largest, and deepest lakes in the world. Many are freshwater, while others are alkaline or soda lakes. </div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y2770 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The Ethiopian Rift Valley forms the northernmost section of the African Rift Valley and splits the Ethiopian </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2771 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">highlands into northern and southern halves. The Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes occupy the floor of the Rift Valley </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2772 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">between the two highlands and most are alkaline. Most of the Ethiopian Rift Valley lakes do not have an </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2773 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">outlet and as such form small pockets of water in the land which the local people have come to live off.

The <span class="ffce">Eastern Rift</span> is home to the Kenyan </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2776 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">lakes, while most of the Central African Rift Valley lakes lie in the Western Rift. Lake Turkana is the largest of </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2777 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">the Kenyan lakes, on the border of Kenya and Ethiopia. The Kenyan section is home to eight lakes, of which </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2778 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">two are freshwater and the rest alkaline. Of the latter, the shallow soda lakes of the Eastern Rift Valley where </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y2779 ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">crystallized salt turns the shores white, are famous for the large flocks of flamingo that feed on shellfish.</div><div class="t m0 x1f h1d y277a ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">The lakes of the <span class="ffce">Western</span> or Albertine Rift, together with Lake Victoria, the second-largest freshwater lake </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y277b ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">in the world, include the largest, deepest, and oldest of the Rift Valley lakes. The Western Rift Valley lakes are </div><div class="t m0 x1d h1d y277c ffcf fs6 fc0 sc0 ls0 ws0">freshwater. They are also referred to as the Central African lakes.
